1) OVERVIEW

This project's intended to help non-coding testers get comfortable with Java code. 
It will explicitly NOT make anyone competent or proficient! It's simply a project
that can be used kata-style for getting less intimidated with Java and whatever
IDE you're using.

2) BUSINESS PROBLEM

Your stakeholder needs a way to calculate net/pre-tax wages for hourly workers.

There are a couple business rules to keep in mind as you work through things:

* Work period is one week.
* Hourly workers get paid straight time for work up to 40 hours per week
	** straight time is their hourly rate times hours worked
* Workers are paid time-and-a-half for hours OVER 40
	** Straight time for the 40 hours, time and a half ONLY for hours
		//over// 40 hours.
		
		
3) SUGGESTED APPROACH

The above business problem statements leave out some critical details you'd need
to resolve in Three Amigos conversations.
